### Cameron Thacker - Bash Basketball

## Current Functionality :

> Limit is currently only 20 possesions in total
> Each player gets one shot, chance to make shot is randomly generated, and also chance to block opposing players shot is randomly generated as well
> At the end, the scores are compared, and the score that is larger is declared the winner

### To start the game, clone the repository, then run the command `chmod +x basketballGame.sh` then run the command `./basketballGame.sh` if your file path is not in the $PATH environment variable, which you can check by using the `printenv` command in your bash terminal
